## Projected Output

### Emotional Attributes of Songs and Playlists
  We will present the mood analysis of certain songs, artists and albums by creating plots and graphs using Shiny.
  
### Musical Mood Analysis by Country
  Do countries differ from each other according to the music they listen to? How? 
  
  We will make inferences and comparisons on certain countries' musical preferences, visualizing their mood attributes, by using Shiny R on local musical charts.
  
### Musical Horoscope
  We will build a Shiny app, where users can enter their (or their loved ones') playlists on Spotify, and see their "musical mood/personality" map.
  There will be twelwe pre-defined *musical horoscope signs* (made-up according to the mood attributes of the playlists), and their definitions to be returned to the user as the output of the app along with their mood analysis plots.

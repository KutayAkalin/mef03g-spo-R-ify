This proposal states the intended work to be performed by **spo-R-ify Group** (member names noted above) for the final project of **Data Analytics Essential** course.

## Working Data
  Our data obtained directly from Spotify Web API. For API connection, we created "Client ID" and "Client Secret" 
from [Spotify for Developers Website](https://developer.spotify.com/). Thus, we can access instantly audios, artists, users and
user playlists data. For further analysis, "spotifyr" package will be used.
  
  
## Purpose of the Project
  Each song is separated within genres, and it's easy to feel it if a song clearly reflects its emotion. So is it possible to describe the emotion of each song using its features such as energy and valence? 
  
  How do two different playlists differ between emotions? 
  
  Curious about all this, we shaped our project. We decided to create emotion maps of songs and music playlists in line with the features of the songs in the data tables that we will obtain using the Spotify WEB API.
  
  
## Projected Output

### Emotional Attributes of Songs and Playlists
  We will present the mood analysis of certain songs, artists and albums by creating plots and graphs using Shiny.
  
### Musical Mood Analysis by Country
  Do countries differ from each other according to the music they listen to? How? 
  
  We will make inferences and comparisons on certain countries' musical preferences, visualizing their mood attributes, by using Shiny R on local musical charts.
  
### Musical Horoscope
  We will build a Shiny app, where users can enter their (or their loved ones') playlists on Spotify, and see their "musical mood/personality" map.
  There will be twelwe pre-defined *musical horoscope signs* (made-up according to the mood attributes of the playlists), and their definitions to be returned to the user as the output of the app along with their mood analysis plots.
